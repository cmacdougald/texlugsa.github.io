<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
I arrived around 12:30 PM to find everyone there. Our two new members showed up with some great Bionicle creations. We instantly went straight to business to discuss the up coming meeting in March. We also took care of some other decisions related to the town layout in March. Lee came up with some dimensions for the layout. We watched some LEGO created movies. Travis and Troy talked about making a monster to terrorize the town layout using Bionicle. We enjoyed some really good peach cobbler. Thanks again Pat for hosting.</p>
