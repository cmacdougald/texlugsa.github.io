<p>So the attendance numbers are in... over 8,500 people. Nice. This is the first time we have completely covered the tables with baseplates and the effect was an extremely polished looking display. Check out <a href="http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?f=238615" title="Sava the Aggie">Tony's pictures</a> of the event. We gave out an entire box of book covers another first.</p>
