  content: It was a great meeting. Pat and John joined us for the afternoon. Connie,
    Sean, and I had fun and enjoyed a nice chicken fried steak. We talked about creating
    a moonbase with GBC type setup for September. I'll work the room issues. We looked
    at the new Lego Education catalog. John and Pat were interested in the <a href='http://www.legoeducation.com/SearchResult.aspx?KeyWords=resource&searchtype=0&sport=3&by=20'
    rel="nofollow"> Resource Kits</a>. We talked about the Houston meeting and Brickfest.
