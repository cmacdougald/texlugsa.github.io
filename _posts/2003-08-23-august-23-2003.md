<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
Simeon showed up with his <a href="http://guide.lugnet.com/set/4512">train #4512</a>, a train moc, and a Spybotic set. We talked a little about train layouts and designs until Pat and Mark showed up. Then, all of us discussed how we would like TexLUG - SA to have meetings and handle news items. We talked about the different sets coming out, I discussed my Brickfest experience, and Pat dove for my parts bucket. I talked a little about how the Racers sets with track could serve as a possible replacement for monorail, my idea of carnival modules, jousting modules, and mini-golf modules.</p>
