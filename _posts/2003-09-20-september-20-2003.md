<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
I showed up around 12:45ish. We started talking about the discussions we have been having online. We came to some kind of agreement on what would be good for us as a LUG and legal issues. Discussed T-shirt ideas. Lee showed us his Harry Potter MOC's Very impressive. Pat and I traded. We talked about pieces and their uses. Pat showed us his ad... that had sets for a $1.50. I built a little. I discussed my carnival module idea again. One of these days I'll get around to making it a build standard. Pat showed us his collection as well as his MOC in progress.</p>
