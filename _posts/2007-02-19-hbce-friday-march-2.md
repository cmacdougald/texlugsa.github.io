<p>Only 12 Days Left Until HBCE! Official Set-Up is on Friday, March 2, 2007 from 1PM to 9PM!</p>
<p>We will be setting up our display for the Healthy Baby and Child Expo at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center in San Antonio on Friday, March 2, 2007. The HBCE Staff allows setup between the hours of 1PM and 9PM. However, to my knowledge you can still bring stuff in on Saturday as a lot of vendors did this last year. Chris M, please issue any corrections on this that you know of. (Chris: Yes but you must be setup before the event opens.)</p>
<p>Location of Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center: 200 East Market Street, San Antonio, Texas 78205 (210) 224-9600</p>
<p><del datetime="2007-02-21T19:26:39+00:00">We will be "offloading" our stuff on the South Alamo Street side (west side) of the convention center. South Alamo Street is 2-way and is perpendicular to East Market Street, which is one-way heading east. So what you want to do is exit Commerce Street from IH-37 South and take Commerce (one-way) west and then turn left on South Alamo Street. You'll cross over East Market Street in the process. Once you pass the loading area on your left, you'll need to do a U-turn to head back north so you can turn in to the loading area.</del></p>
<p>(The above unloading information is incorrect! See above post dated February 21, 2007.)</p>
<p>There is a nice parking garage on South Bowie Street and situated between East Commerce and East Market. If you get lost, remember that the Tower of the Americas (tallest thing in San Antonio) is across from the southeast corner of the convention center, so drive towards that!</p>
<p>For good recon photos, use Google Maps, paste the convention center address into the search box, hit <Enter>, and then click the Hybrid icon. Zoom in a bit and you can definitely see the convention center and<br />
the offloading area to the left.</p>
<p>For the record, I (Pat) plan to be at the Convention Center on Friday at 1PM or shortly thereafter.</p>
