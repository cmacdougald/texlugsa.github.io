<p><strong>Meeting Information</strong><br />
See below for post meeting information.</p>
<p>Update - 02/13/2004 - Northwest Vista College has agreed to lend us the Banquet Room in the College Commons building. Time has been discussed below. This is located about 5 minutes from my house, so room for you out-of-towners is available on a first come first serve basis.</p>

<p><strong>Pre Meeting Information</strong><br />
I have come up with a preliminary draft of the layout for this meeting. Please take a look at the PNG image. Please let me know what space you would like or what changes you would like made. When refering to the diagram I would like to use letters for the columns and numbers for the rows. For example, the upper left corner section of track is A1-B2.<br />
Please tell me which road plates you will be using and where so I can put them in.</p>
<p>I was thinking that the blue plate table could be put on wheels so we could roll the sea in and out to get around the layout. Also, we could run a track to go over an inside section for the bridge builders out there. I thought it would be a good idea to have the bridges on the inside so no one messes with them. Just in case they fall, we don't have to look everywhere for pieces.</p>

<p><strike>Location is still being worked out.</strike> Time is from 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM Saturday and 10:00 AM - 3:00 PM Sunday. I was planning on having the public access from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM on Saturday and from Noon - 2:00 PM on Sunday. Input is more than welcome. Also, we are going <strike>to attempt</strike> to inform the media.</p>
<p>We should be hearing from San Antonio Express-News soon. Also, there might be some TV crews there. Be sure to wear your t-shirts.</p>
<p>Monorail is allowed and encouraged in the layout with the following height requirements. 15 bricks in height in all locations except when coming in and out of a station then it can go to 5. Please let me know where you would like your track to be and I'll figure out where it goes on the layout map.</p>
<p>Please check back here as any changes will be posted here.</p>
