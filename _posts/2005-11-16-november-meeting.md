<p>Hey folks:</p>
<p>Lee Rahe and I had a smashing idea the other day: TexLUG-SA should meet one last time before the silly season begins, as we don't get a chance to meet again until January or later. This will also be Lee's last opportunity to join us this month.</p>
<p>At the Business Expo a few months ago, Chris Macdougald and I had another smashing idea: Next time we meet, let's try the Blue Cactus Cafe. They served great brisket at their booth.</p>
<p>So why not, thought I, combine the two?</p>
<p>When: November 19, 2005; 2:00 to 4:00 PM<br />
Where: Blue Cactus Cafe, 13525 Wetmore Road (one block<br />
north of Thousand Oaks), San Antonio, Texas 78247, ph:<br />
(210) 490-7330<br />
What: Meet to welcome our newest member, Rebecca Chavez, trade the latest in LEGO scuttlebutt, trade parts, whatever, and eat a late lunch/early dinner.</p>
<p>Not sure if Mark Bagnell's computer is working yet or nay, so I'll inform him by phone.</p>
<p>Chris, I'm hoping you and Connie can make it this weekend, but also please inform anyone that I have not included in this email, if you would be so kind.</p>
<p>The URL for the Blue Cactus Cafe:</p>
<p>http://www.thebluecactuscafe.com/</p>
<p>Here you will find their menu, their history, and a MAP IT! link (near the bottom) that shows you how to locate them.</p>
<p>Hope to see you all there!</p>
<p>- Pat</p>
