<p>Greetings fellow TexLUG-ers,</p>
<p>Lee and I feel it is high time for a TexLUG meeting with the San Antonio (and New Braunfels) folks. Of course, all TexLUG is invited.</p>
<p>We would like to meet on Saturday, May 13, 2006 at 1PM.</p>
<p>We propose as our May meeting place <a title="1901 Weil Road in Marion, Texas 78124" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=1901+Weil+Road,+Marion,+Texas+78124&ll=29.594058,-98.200607&spn=0.017352,0.036607&om=1">Goerke's Country Tavern</a>, 1901 Weil Road in Marion, Texas 78124  (actually "5 and 1/2 miles west of Marion".)</p>
<p>Goerke's may be familiar to at least four members of our group. For the rest of you, it is a place that has nice long tables suitable for LEGO meets, and they serve food of the type that requires lots of napkins and makes it futile to try to be polite while eating it.</p>
<p>So bring your MOCs, trades, your LEGO news (or any news) and your hungry selves to Goerke's and let's remind each other what we look like!</p>
