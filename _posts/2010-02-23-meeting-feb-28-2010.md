<p>Seriously, I need to stop being so busy. Things are not going to slow down so I've decided to go ahead and have a meeting anyway. We have a lot going on this year with an event just about every month.</p>
<p>When: Sunday, Feb 28, 2010 @ 2PM</p>
<p>Where: Fuddruckers @ I10 &amp; Wurbach</p>
<p>Who: AFOLs and other LEGO Enthusiasts</p>
<p>Why: Long over due!</p>
<p>How: Bring yourself and something you are currently building.</p>
<p>See you there!</p>
