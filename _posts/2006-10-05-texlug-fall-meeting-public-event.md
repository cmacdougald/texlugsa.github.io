    Gerf.org (our mailing list) seems to be down. I have posted two messages to gerf within the last week and they have not appeared in my work inbox or my Yahoo inbox. Here's what I tried to post in the last message:

    "All,

    An update: I've completed my two Moonbase Modules. However, with my Castle module, I find my light gray bricks being eaten up very rapidly, despite 1) the relatively small size of the module and 2) the fact that I purchased over 400 light gray bricks from BrickLink for just this purpose.

    I never really thought about it, but it is apparent now that castle stuff eats far more gray bricks than most space modules, since space (classic, anyway) modules can utilize all sorts of alternative parts to build decent structures. There aren't a great variety of alternatives for building castle walls.

    In any case, the best I can do at this point is four castle sections: 4 corners, or 2 walls and 2 corners, or 4 walls. I find I am especially fast running out of inverted 45&Agrave;&ouml; slopes, 1 x 6 bricks, 2 x 4 bricks, 1 x 3 bricks, and 1 x 1 bricks. I am going to order more today but I don't know if they'll arrive in time for me to make something out of them and get them to Houston. Being a space freak I naturally have umpteen light gray plates, 1 x 4 bricks, and 1 x 2 bricks; no worries there.

    So I guess my question is this: Is there anyway I can collaborate with someone on a castle module? Ideally, I can really only afford (in terms of time and available resources) 2 castle standard wall or corner sections, thus saving what I have to construct for an actual, if small, fortification.

    I welcome all suggestions and ideas. Meanwhile, I'm placing another order. Now."

    Update: I've already ordered those bricks, and they should be arriving before this weekend. In the meantime, can anyone explain the mailing list mystery?
