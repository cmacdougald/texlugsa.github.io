<p>Hello, I'm the <strong>newest</strong> member to the San Antonio LUGz! I'm an aspiring AFOL, and I want to grow up to be just like my team members. Let me introduce myself:</p>
<p>My named is Brandi, and I'm a lego addict. Not recovering...I received two boxes of Legos for Valentines' Day. Before that, I collected the mini lego kits before</p>
<p>getting into the big stuff. Does this sound like you? If so, you should fit right in with us. The guys here are really cool and we are very family oriented. Have kids?</p>
<p>Bring them along!</p>
<p>I love Star Wars Legos! and also any type of vehicles that I can build. I haven't quite yet started a MOC, but, it will be soon to come! Anyway, I've added a video for all to see.</p>
<p>Any Questions? Ask me! I love to help out .</p>
<p>Check this out....</p>
