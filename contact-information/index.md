    No location in San Antonio that I know of.  Your best bet would be BrickLink.com.  It's set up similar to Ebay and their "buy it now" fixed prices.  I'm not sure the part you're referring to, but here's an example:
    http://www.bricklink.com/search.asp?itemID=9494&amp;colorID=9
    I personally have bought from several bricklink vendors before without issue, however TexLUG is not affiliated with BrickLink in any way and does not endorse or sponsor them.
